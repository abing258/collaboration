## Hamster

### Project Description
Hamster is a decentralized computing network based on an underlying chain. It aims to provide users with cost-effective computing servers. It is a decentralized computing resource leasing platform that allows for leasing of idle computing resources. There are many cloud computing service vendors providing cloud computing services, but currently the prices of cloud computing services are gradually stabilized and high as the services expand. The goal of our product is to utilize the current idle computing resources in people's hands in a decentralized manner, so that users in need can use computing services in a low-cost manner. The project starts from providing full-stack hosting for blockchain application services as the usage scenario of shared computing services. Based on decentralized computing power sharing and automation technology, non-technical users can join the project with one click, which is safe, reliable, and free of operation and maintenance, greatly reducing the threshold to enter the blockchain world. As long as you have a computer, electricity and internet, you can provide computing power to many blockchain projects through Hamster and gain revenue; as long as you want to join web3, you can become a node of any popular blockchain project through Hamster and gain revenue with just one click.
#### An indication of why this project is good for the Darwinia ecosystem.
Hamster serves as an infrastructure service that provides Darwinia with computing power and effectively helps Darwinia promote
#### An indication of how you will integrate this project into Darwinia.
We can succeed Darwinia's partners

### Development Roadmap
- Hamster Node: is a custom node built on Substrate 3.0.
- Hamster Gateway: p2p gateway with public IP, used to link information between resource provider and resource user, built with libp2p component, is the cornerstone of the leased resource availability, can register itself to Hamster Node. That includes the Register, Receive rewards and Configuration modules
- Hamster Provider: can provide compute resources and register them with Hamster Node. Compute resources are provided using both vm virtual machine technology and docker technology. Currently vm virtual machine technology is used to better protect user privacy. That includes the Initialize configuration, Resource details, Account information and Configuration information modules
- Hamster Client: On the client, you can create and deploy some project services, such as the graph indexer, which can be one click deployment of projects. During deployment, resources and gateways provided remotely will be used, including some operations of the graph indexer, such as take, unstak,receive income, withraw stake, etc.
- Hamster-contracts:The proxy contract used when deploying the graph indexer. Let the indexer perform take, unstake, withraw and other operations through the proxy contract

- Total funding amount: 6,000 USDT
- First milestone (1 month)
    Implement Hamster Provider，Hamster Node,Hamster Gateway Modules
    Documentation: Hamster will provide online documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that includes installation and use tutorial.Testing Guide: Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, Hamster will describe how to run these tests.
    Article: Hamster will write an article or tutorial that explains the work done as part of the grant.
